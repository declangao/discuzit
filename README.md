A Reddit clone built with Next.js(app router), TypeScript, tRPC, Tailwind, Prisma and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

Development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Note

I did not configure my Google sign in to work with the demo production URL. To test this feature, use your own GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in dev environment.
